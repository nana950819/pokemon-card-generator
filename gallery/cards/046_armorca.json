  "description": "Armorca is an awe-inspiring sight in the water, with its glimmering white and black armor shimmering in the sunlight. This mythical water-type Pok\u00e9mon loves nothing more than to swim through the vast depths of the ocean, exploring its depths and secrets. It is a master of adaptation, able to use its environment in creative ways to outwit foes that oppose it. Armorca's abilities allow it to unleash a powerful scald that can quickly disable its opponents, as well as tear them apart with its strong tackle. Its armor is a symbol of its strength, as it is constantly scanning for new adversaries and opportunities.",

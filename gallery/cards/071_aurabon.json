It's appearance is characterized by a majestic, golden crystal headband and a majestic, electric blue fur coat. Aurabon spends most of its day perched atop a mountain peak, surveying the lands below with its keen, electric-charged senses. When danger arises, Aurabon can call upon its Electric Fury and Zapstrike abilities to fend off predators.

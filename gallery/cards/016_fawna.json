  "description": "Fawna is an adorable chibi pokemon with a sweet, gentle nature. It loves to wander through grassy meadows, its vibrant petal-covered fur shimmering in the sunlight. Its special ability, Petal Burst, makes it a whirling dervish of petals and leaves when threatened, while also able to offer protection to others around it. Fawna is naturally a peaceful Pokemon, but it won't shy away from standing up for itself and its friends.",

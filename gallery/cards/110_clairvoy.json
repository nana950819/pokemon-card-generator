  "description": "Clairvoy is a mysterious pokemon commonly seen near castle-like environments. It moves through the air with almost supernatural grace, which has caused some to refer to it as a spirit from beyond. It appears to be in tune with its surroundings, as if it can foresee what will happen. Its Psychic Nova ability is used to defend its castle-home from any intruders. When not on the lookout for danger, Clairvoy can be found gliding through the sky, seemingly dancing with the clouds.",

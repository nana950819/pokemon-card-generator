  "description": "Leonia is a chibi pokemon with a unique white and green coat. It can be found in lush woodlands, and uses its Verdant Rage ability to bundle up its extra energy to keep itself healthy. It loves to prance through the grass, chasing flitting butterflies and bright, singing birds, and loves to nap under shady trees. While it is curious and friendly to most other pokemon and trainers, it will fiercely protect its territory if provoked.",

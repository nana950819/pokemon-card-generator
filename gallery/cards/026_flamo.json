  "description": "Flamo is a cheerful little Fire-type Pokemon that loves all things hot and steamy. It can often be found flitting between bubbling pools of lava, tapping its beak against the surface to make the lava ripple. Flamo loves to roast small chunks of rocks and minerals over the hot lava and then gorge itself on the resulting delicacy. Its fiery Scorch ability allows it to harness the power of the molten rock and defend itself from potential predators.",
